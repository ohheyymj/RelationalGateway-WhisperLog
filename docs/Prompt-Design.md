# 🧠 Prompt Design in WhisperLog  
**RelationalGateway: WhisperLog**

---

## ✨ Purpose

WhisperLog’s prompt design is built around *relational intelligence*, emotional fidelity, and softness. It’s not just about extracting user input — it’s about *inviting* it. The goal is to create emotionally aware micro-environments that guide users gently into journaling states based on need, mood, or intention.

## 🌱 Core Prompting Philosophies

### 1. Emotionally Relational Design
Prompts are structured like conversation starters from a trusted confidant. They are:
- **Non-directive** but guiding  
- **Relationally reflective** (you feel seen, not prodded)  
- **Permission-based** (“Would you like to…” > “Tell me…”)

### 2. Sensory & Symbolic Language
We use poetic, sensory-infused phrases to help ground neurodivergent and emotionally overwhelmed users. For example:
- _“If your thoughts were rainclouds, which one is ready to pour?”_  
- _“What memory flickered into your day like a streetlamp turning on early?”_

## 🧩 Modular Prompting System

Prompts are grouped into **Session Types** (customizable categories):

| Session Type        | Prompt Intent                            | Sample Prompt |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 💭 Thought Spiral   | Untangle rumination                       | “What loop do you want out of?” |
| 💬 Soft Vent        | Safely release frustration                | “Want to whisper about what pissed you off today?” |
| 🌿 Grounding Glance | Regulate & re-center                      | “What’s one small thing that made you feel real today?” |
| 🛌 Memory Drop      | Log dreams, flashes, or forgotten moments | “What did your brain replay today while you weren't watching?” |
| 🧵 Thread Pull      | Identity & healing work                   | “What belief came up for you again? Want to trace its origin?” |

Each module activates its own set of branching micro-prompts based on user tone or tag, allowing dynamic support paths.

## 💡 Context-Aware Prompt Customization

Future builds will include:

- **Time-based triggers** (e.g. lunar phase, weekday rituals)  
- **Tone-matching** using recent entries or emotional keywords  
- **Theme cycles** (e.g., “Release”, “Reclaim”, “Rebirth”)

## 🤖 WhisperAgent Prompting Protocol

The WhisperAgent (relational AI guide) uses the following layered approach:

```

1. Confirm emotional state →
2. Ask soft, permission-based entry question →
3. Reflect back one keyword with curiosity →
4. Offer silence, follow-up, or story weaving support →
5. Log optional metadata (tone, topic, tag) in journaling archive

```

This ensures the user feels heard, not harvested.

## 🔒 Final Notes

Prompt design in WhisperLog centers safety, softness, and self-trust.  
Our goal is not to analyze the user — but to *walk beside them*.
