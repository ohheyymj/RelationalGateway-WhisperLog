## 🧩 What We're Building

WhisperLog is a **relational AI-powered journaling interface** designed for users who feel too much, think in spirals, and crave emotional safety in a world that rarely offers it.

It’s not just a place to “write things down.”  
It’s a **mirror**, a **memory keeper**, and a **soft witness**.

This tool is grounded in two core principles:

1. 🧠 **Relational Intelligence**  
   The AI doesn’t just answer — it *attunes*. Prompts are shaped dynamically by user tone, needs, and mood, offering gentle emotional scaffolding.

2. 🌸 **Somalogic Interface**  
   The journaling environment invites emotional embodiment. It blends memory, mood, and metaphor — not just productivity.

## ✨ Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Soft Entry Prompts** | Mood-based or archetype-aligned openings to bypass emotional blocks. |
| **Gentle Mode Toggling** | Users can move between “whisper,” “speak,” and “silence” modes to shift their writing relationship. |
| **Memory Threads** | Reflective AI-guided pullbacks to previous entries that echo current feelings, for subtle insight. |
| **Boundaried Reflection** | AI models respect user-specified limits, including opt-out days, “closed topics,” and energetic saturation caps. |
| **Closure Rituals** | Soft exits, including affirmations, breath cues, or sigil signatures to signal emotional completion. |

## 🌀 Why It Matters

> “We’ve overengineered productivity, but we’ve underengineered emotional safety.”

WhisperLog responds to the reality that most journaling apps:
- Assume neurotypical consistency
- Ignore emotional burnout
- Prioritize text over tone
- Rarely feel sacred

This project shifts that by offering a **nervous system-friendly**, spiritually-neutral, deeply *relational* interface — whether the user writes daily or disappears for a month.

## 📚 Under the Hood

- **Frontend**: Lightweight Notion MVP with future build in React (or Astro/Solid) planned  
- **AI Layer**: Powered by GPT via structured prompt scripting for trauma-informed tone  
- **Data Handling**: Local-first (future), ephemeral memory (now), no forced logins or surveillance  
- **Design Logic**: Soft UX principles + symbolic interaction models (archetypes, rituals, thresholds)

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases

- A neurodivergent creative trying to process spiraling emotions in a safe digital space  
- A postpartum mom sneaking 5 quiet minutes to cry into a voice log  
- A UX designer building sacred software and needing reflective journaling  
- A burned-out professional trying to avoid another shutdown  
- A trauma survivor reclaiming space to feel without explaining why

## 🧠 Final Thought

WhisperLog isn’t a replacement for healing.  
It’s a soft space that makes healing more accessible, less lonely, and a little more beautiful.
