## 🧭 Overview

**WhisperLog** is a trauma-informed, soft journaling experience designed to meet users where they are — gently, safely, and with emotional nuance.

Built as a focused tentacle of the larger [RelationalGateway: Origins](https://github.com/ohheyymj/RelationalGateway-Origins) system, WhisperLog offers a lightweight, modular interface for:

- Emotional check-ins  
- Tone-mapped journaling  
- Symbolic expression  
- Pattern tracking  
- AI-guided reflection

WhisperLog helps users *whisper into the system what they can't yet scream to the world* — and be met with resonance, not resistance.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

> "Some thoughts aren’t meant to be harvested.  
They’re meant to be held."

We don’t capture data — we co-create safety.  
We don’t force insights — we offer presence.  
This is not AI to replace therapy.  
This is relational technology to reclaim your voice.
